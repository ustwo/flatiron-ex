# flatiron-ex
Flatiron School exercise

<h4>INTRO</h4>
This repo contains a practical exploration of the exercise completed by Flatiron School at ustwo. It includes coded solutions, in an Xcode Playground, to the problem of keeping a running median for any given set of numbers. All three of the proposed solutions - brute force, dual array, and heap - are outlined in three classes: RunningMedian, AnotherRunningMedian, and BetterRunningMedian, each with comments describing the important moving parts.

The project is set up in such a way as to allow you to make your own modifications to the code to further your understanding of data structures, and the unique challenges of efficiently modeling for large datasets.

<h4>SETUP AND EXECUTION</h4>
The Heaps Playground demonstrates the code discussed in the talk. Make sure you build the FlatironSchool framework before running the Playground.
